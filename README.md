# Lyric Cloud

This is an App made by two students of CITM for the subject of Mobile Devices.

## Features

In this App the user can press any song an its lyrics will be displayed. In addition, if a song in the list is pressed for a while, it will be saved into a Favourites List. The user can see the songs saved by pressing the favourites button in the songs list. Finally, if the user presses a song in the Favourites List, this will be deleted from the list.

All the data is storaged and managed from Firebase.
